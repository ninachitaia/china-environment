># I. Sources and Methodology

> ## Media Selection
We selected newspapers sources as our objects of study. Newspapers provide their readers with both detailed and continuous information  on environmental issues. The authority in newspapers cannot be substituted by any other media. In particular, newspapers can provide a historical perspective on public opinion that may not be otherwise possible. 

>Our mainland sources include China Daily, Shanghai Daily, Global Times, and People’s Daily, and, our Hong-Kong-based source is South China Morning Post. Current editions as well as extensive archives of our sources are available online in digitized format. 

>China Daily is a so-called "state-run" newspaper. Its editorial policies are slightly more liberal than most other Chinese newspapers. It aims to provide information both to foreigners in China and to Chinese wishing to improve their English language skills. Shanghai Daily, the largest English-language newspaper in East China, serves an audience of expats living in Shanghai, foreign investors and Shanghai white-collar workers who are fluent in English. People's Daily, the biggest newspaper group in China, is an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. It is commonly considered to provide direct information on points of view of the Party and its policies. Global Times, an English newspaper under People's Daily, considers itself to be the only English newspaper that conveys to foreign countries comprehensive news in line with realities of China. Last but not least, South China Morning Post, before being acquired by Chinese mainland technology giant Alibaba in 2016, was owned by European conglomerates for a long period of time. South China Morning Post provides a perspective largely independent of Chinese central government prerogatives. We extracted data from different newspapers to find similarities and differences as to how each of them frames environmental issues in China.

> ## Methodology
>In order to analyze and compare discourse on climate change in Chinese media, we used the Factiva database to collect over 16,000 articles from January 2000 to October 2017. In order to reduce noise, such as discussion of the "economic" or "school environment", and target our research towards analyzing how climate change has been discussed in Chinese media, we limited the scope of articles based on their ‘Subject’ categories on Factiva. As described below, we narrowed the article subjects down to, for example, ‘Air/Water/Land Quality’ and ‘Natural Environment’. In order to analyze the resulting corpus, we used digital methods available online through the [Cortext](http://www.cortext.net) platform, including demography analysis, network mapping, topic modeling, and contingency matrices.
